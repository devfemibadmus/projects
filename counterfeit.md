## **Introduction**

With the rise of counterfeit products in industries like food and cosmetics, ensuring product authenticity is crucial for consumer trust. Traditional validation methods rely on centralized databases, requiring significant resources and maintenance. This proposal introduces a stateless QR code validation system that uses a cryptographic algorithm to verify authenticity without storing or managing large-scale data.

## **Objective**

To develop a **resource-efficient, stateless** QR code validation system that allows consumers to verify product authenticity through a mathematical computation instead of database lookups or third-party verification.

## **System Overview**

The system will generate QR codes containing encoded product data and a cryptographic hash. Upon scanning, a verification algorithm will compute the expected hash and compare it with the one stored in the QR code. If the computed and stored hashes match, the product is verified as authentic.

## **Key Features**

1.  **No Database Required:** The system relies solely on deterministic calculations rather than external lookups.
2.  **Tamper-Resistant:** The QR code contains a cryptographic signature that cannot be altered without invalidating verification.
3.  **Fast & Efficient:** Instant verification through a local or web-based script.
4.  **Offline Capability:** The system can work locally without internet dependency.
5.  **Scalable & Cost-Effective:** Eliminates the need for expensive cloud storage and server infrastructure.

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **1. QR Code Generation**

Each product will have a unique QR code containing:

```
product_id | batch_no | hash(product_id + batch_no + secret_key)

```

Where:

-   `product_id` = Unique identifier of the product
-   `batch_no` = Production batch number
-   `secret_key` = A manufacturer-only known key
-   `hash()` = A cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256)

### **2. QR Code Verification Process**

-   When a consumer scans the QR code, the validation script extracts `product_id` and `batch_no`.
-   It then recomputes the hash using the predefined formula.
-   If the computed hash matches the hash in the QR code, the product is authentic.

### **3. Security Measures**

-   **Secret Key Protection:** Only manufacturers know the key, preventing unauthorized QR code generation.
-   **Checksum Validation:** Additional security layers can be added to detect tampering.
-   **Time-Based or Batch-Based Keys:** Rotating keys periodically enhances security.

## **Use Case Example**

1.  A manufacturer generates QR codes for each product before packaging.
2.  A consumer scans the QR code using a validation app or web-based checker.
3.  The app processes the QR code and validates authenticity instantly.
4.  If valid, the product is confirmed as genuine; otherwise, a warning is displayed.

## **Benefits**

-   **Consumer Trust:** Shoppers can instantly verify authenticity without relying on third-party verification.
-   **No Infrastructure Costs:** Eliminates the need for database maintenance and storage.
-   **Scalable & Universal:** Works across industries including food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

## **Conclusion**

This stateless QR code validation system offers a lightweight, secure, and scalable solution for product authentication. By leveraging cryptographic calculations instead of traditional database storage, businesses can enhance security while reducing operational costs. Implementing this system will provide a seamless and trustworthy experience for consumers while protecting brands from counterfeiting.
