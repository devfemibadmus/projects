## Key Differences:
- **Communication:**  
  - **GF-07** relies solely on **SMS** for tracking, which can be slower and less reliable for real-time updates.  
  - **GF-09** uses both **SMS** and **GPRS**, providing better real-time tracking.  
  - **TK103B** uses **GPRS** for real-time data transfer, allowing faster and more frequent updates compared to SMS-based trackers.

- **Battery Life:**  
  - **GF-07** has the shortest battery life (about 4 hours).  
  - **GF-09** has a much longer battery life (48 hours).  
  - **TK103B** typically lasts for **2-3 days**, depending on settings and usage.

- **Additional Features:**  
  - **GF-09** has additional features like **geofencing**, **SOS button**, **voice monitoring**, and **accident detection**.  
  - **TK103B** supports **geofencing** and **SOS alerts** but lacks **voice monitoring** and **accident detection**.

- **App Integration:**  
  - **GF-07** and **GF-09** do not offer a mobile app for tracking.  
  - **TK103B** can be tracked via third-party apps that support GPRS tracking.

## Conclusion:
- **GF-07**: Best for budget-conscious users who need basic tracking with SMS but are okay with limited features and battery life.
- **GF-09**: A step up from the GF-07, offering better battery life, more features (like accident detection and remote listening), and real-time tracking via SMS/GPRS.
- **TK103B**: Ideal for users who need reliable GPRS-based real-time tracking, with basic features like geofencing and SOS, at a more affordable price point.

# Development Using GF-07/GF-09/TK103B

## Overview

This system involves three types of GPS tracking devices: **GF-07**, **GF-09**, and **TK103B**. Each device will transmit location data to a server, where the data will be stored and processed. The system also includes a **frontend dashboard** for real-time tracking of the devices.

### Key Components
1. **Mobile Device** - Sends location data via SMS (GF-07) or GPRS (GF-09/TK103B).
2. **Server (Database)** - Receives and stores the location data.
3. **Frontend Dashboard** - Displays location data in real-time.

## GF-07 Device
[https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/2024-Hot-Selling-GF-07-Tracker_1601075883238.html](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/2024-Hot-Selling-GF-07-Tracker_1601075883238.html)
GF-07 is a GPS tracker that communicates using **SMS**. The mobile device sends location data at regular intervals (every 1 minute) via SMS to a server, which then processes and stores the received data.

### Development Breakdown

1. **Mobile Device**  
   - The mobile device sends an SMS every 1 minute, containing the GPS location of the device.
   - The system is responsible for sending the SMS and ensuring it is delivered.

2. **Server (Database)**  
   - The server receives the SMS data from the mobile device.
   - Upon receiving the SMS, the server will parse the data (e.g., latitude, longitude) and store it in the database.

3. **Frontend Dashboard**  
   - The dashboard will display the real-time GPS location of the devices on a map.

### Cost Analysis

The **GF-07** device uses SMS for communication, which incurs the following costs:

- **Cost per SMS**: (Amount per SMS, depends on your carrier)
- **SMS Interval**: 1 minute
- **Total SMS per Day**: 1440 (1 SMS per minute x 24 hours)
- **Total Daily Cost per Device**: `(Cost per SMS x 1440) x 2 (for both sending and receiving SMS)`

**Example Cost Breakdown:**

- If the cost per SMS is $0.05:
  - `(4 x 1440) x 2 = NGN11,520 per device per day`
  
The main cost here is the **SMS and airtime** for both sending location updates and receiving tracking data.

## GF-09 Device
[https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/GF-09-Mini-Car-Pet-Tracking_1601286615165.html](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/GF-09-Mini-Car-Pet-Tracking_1601286615165.html)
GF-09 is a more advanced GPS tracker that supports **GPRS** communication, reducing the need for SMS. This device can send data over a network, using the internet for communication instead of relying on SMS.

### Development Breakdown

1. **Mobile Device**  
   - The device will use **GPRS** for communication and connect to the company’s Wi-Fi or internet service.
   - Data can be sent using more efficient protocols like **WebSockets**, enabling real-time updates.

2. **Server (Database)**  
   - The server will receive location data via GPRS or WebSocket and store it in the database.
   - This connection will be more reliable and cost-effective compared to SMS, reducing operational costs.

3. **Frontend Dashboard**  
   - The dashboard will receive real-time location data from the device through the GPRS or WebSocket connection, displaying updates instantly.

### Cost Analysis

The **GF-09** device uses **GPRS** communication, which incurs the following costs:

- **Internet Access**: The cost of the internet connection for sending data to the server.
- **Tracking Device Connection**: The device will connect to the company’s Wi-Fi, reducing the need for a mobile network.

Since the device uses internet-based communication, the primary cost here is the **internet access** for the device and the server, significantly reducing the cost of SMS (compared to GF-07).

## TK103B Device
[https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/TK103-Vehicle-GPS-Tracking-System-Real_62206821769.html](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/TK103-Vehicle-GPS-Tracking-System-Real_62206821769.html)
The **TK103B** is another GPS tracker with **GPRS** functionality, similar to the **GF-09**, but with some added features like **SOS panic button**, **voice monitoring**, and **geofence capabilities**. It can also communicate over **SMS** for backup in case GPRS is unavailable.

### Development Breakdown

1. **Mobile Device**  
   - The device can operate over **GPRS**, but can also fall back to SMS if the internet connection is unstable or unavailable.
   - Features like **SOS button** and **voice monitoring** add extra functionalities that the system should be prepared to handle.

2. **Server (Database)**  
   - The server will receive location data via GPRS or SMS, depending on network availability.
   - The system should also handle special messages from the device like **SOS alerts** and **geofence breach notifications**.

3. **Frontend Dashboard**  
   - The dashboard will handle real-time updates from GPRS communication but also be able to display emergency notifications like **SOS alerts** and **geofence breaches**.

### Cost Analysis

The **TK103B** device offers a similar cost structure to **GF-09**, as it uses **GPRS** for communication. However, if it falls back to **SMS** (e.g., in areas without internet access), the costs will be similar to the **GF-07**.

- **Cost per SMS**: (if used for fallback communication)
- **Internet Access**: (for GPRS communication)
- **Special Feature Costs**: Monitoring services like **voice calls** or **SOS alerts** may have additional costs associated with them.
