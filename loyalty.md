### **Blockchain-Based QR Code Loyalty Program**

A **blockchain-powered QR code loyalty program** ensures security, transparency, and prevents fraud by using **immutable records** for each QR scan.

----------

### **How It Works**

1.  **QR Code Generation (NFT-like Unique Codes)**
    
    -   Each product (e.g., Indomie pack) has a **unique QR code** stored on the blockchain.
    -   This QR code represents a **unique digital asset (block)**, ensuring it cannot be duplicated or reused.
2.  **Customer Scans QR Code**
    
    -   When a customer **scans** the QR code, a transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
    -   The system **checks** if the QR code has been scanned before:
        -   **If not scanned** â†’ Marks it as **used** and credits reward points to the user.
        -   **If already scanned** â†’ Rejects the request (prevents fraud).
3.  **Immutable Record on Blockchain**
    
    -   Each scan is a **block in the chain**, making every transaction verifiable and tamper-proof.
    -   Customers can track their reward history on a **public ledger**.
4.  **Redemption & Smart Contracts**
    
    -   Points are stored in a **digital wallet** connected to the blockchain.
    -   Customers **redeem rewards** (discounts, free products) via **smart contracts**, ensuring automated and secure transactions.
