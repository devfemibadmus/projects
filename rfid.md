### **RFID-Enabled Raw Material Tracking in Tolaram (e.g., Dufil & Other Subsidiaries)**

#### **Overview of RFID in Raw Material Tracking**

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology used to track and manage raw materials in real-time. It involves attaching RFID tags to materials, which are then scanned using RFID readers to automate inventory tracking, reduce losses, and improve operational efficiency.

#### **How It Works in Tolaram (e.g., Dufil, etc.)**

1.  **Tagging Raw Materials:** Attach RFID tags to raw materials (e.g., wheat, palm oil, seasoning ingredients, etc.).
2.  **Automated Scanning:** RFID readers placed at warehouses, production lines, and checkpoints automatically scan materials, updating inventory in real-time.
3.  **Inventory Management:** The system records material movement from suppliers to warehouses, and from warehouses to production units.
4.  **Quality & Expiry Tracking:** RFID enables tracking of expiration dates and batch information, reducing waste and ensuring quality compliance.
5.  **Security & Loss Prevention:** Prevents material theft or misplacement by monitoring stock movement.

#### **Where It Will Be Useful in Tolaram’s Subsidiaries (Example: Dufil Prima Foods)**

1.  **Warehouse & Supply Chain Management** – Helps manage bulk ingredients for Indomie production.
2.  **Production Line Monitoring** – Ensures accurate material usage and prevents shortages or overuse.
3.  **Logistics & Distribution** – Tracks materials from suppliers to factories, reducing delays.
4.  **Food Safety & Compliance** – Helps in recall management by tracing raw material sources.

This system can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance accountability across Tolaram’s supply chain.
